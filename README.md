# Typesense Homebrew Tap

This repo contains Typesense's Homebrew Tap.

## Compatibility

We only recommend using homebrew for macOS Ventura (13.x) or above, running on an Intel CPU.

For older versions of macOS running on an Intel CPU and for all versions of macOS running on Apple M1/M2 CPUs, we recommend using the [Docker](https://typesense.org/docs/guide/install-typesense.html#docker) or [Docker Compose](https://typesense.org/docs/guide/install-typesense.html#docker-compose) installation method for compatibility and performance reasons.

## Installation

To install the latest version of Typesense:

```
brew install typesense/tap/typesense-server
```

To install a specific version of Typesense:

```
brew install typesense/tap/typesense-server@0.25.0
```

## Documentation

where `${HOMEBREW_PREFIX}` is usually `/usr/local`.

### Start service

To start the `typesense-server` service:

If you don't see `{"ok": true}`, check the logs under `${HOMEBREW_PREFIX}/var/log/typesense/` for any issues or progress.

`${HOMEBREW_PREFIX}` is usually `/usr/local`.

## Tap Developer Workflow

This section is only applicable if you're adding a new version to this tap.

### Dependencies

`brew install curl sha2` (curl is keg-only, so make sure it is available in `PATH` following the post-install instructions)

### Add a new version

1. Add new version to `scripts/generate_forumlae.rb` (at the top of the array if it's the latest version)
2. Run `bundle install && bundle exec ruby scripts/generate_formulae.rb` to generate the formulae for all versions
3. Run `brew style . --fix` (then make sure any linting fixes are applied to the template string, then regenerate the formula once again)
4. Test locally `brew install ./Formula/typesense-server@0.25.0.rb --debug`
